# Netflex-clone-using-Tailwind-css
I recently designed a Netflex clone using Tailwind CSS, focusing on mobile responsiveness. The project utilizes simple HTML and incorporates Tailwind CSS through CDN integration. I'm excited to showcase the code on GitHub, providing an accessible and responsive design solution. Check it out and feel free to provide any feedback!
